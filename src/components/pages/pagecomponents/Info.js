      I am very proud of this as this was the first project I was able to complete
      when I first started to learn java.
      Being able to get it on to this site represents the journey I have been on.
      My first mortgage calculator was a command line app using java.
      My knowledge of javascript and creating UI's allowed me to fuse the two together
      to make this.
